# Student Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project contains a **basic student dashboard** created using Excel.  
The purpose of this dashboard is not to serve as a visual masterpiece but rather to **demonstrate core functionalities** such as data filtering and visualization.  

## Features
- **Data Filtering with Slicers**  
  Allows users to quickly filter student records and focus on specific segments.  

- **Attendance Visualization**  
  Provides an easy way to view student attendance over time.  

## Notes
- Due to time commitments, this version is kept simple and minimal.  
- The main goal is to **showcase how raw data can be turned into an interactive dashboard**.  
- A more visually polished and advanced version can be created in the future with additional time and resources.  

## Files
